## Why?

People keep asking me how to get started and I always tell them to go through these resources.


## Your First Computer Science Class

Just take this [free online course from Harvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). Seriously, don't bother with a bootcamp if you're just looking for the basics this will do it. 


## Git and Source Version Control

A great book for getting familiar with git and version control  is [Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). The book is freely available through a creative commons license and it comes in almost every format needed (pdf, mobi, epub, web, etc). It's a little lengthy but to get started one only really has to read the first three or four chapters.

## Linux Command Line BASH: 
[Another great free book on linux command line BASH by William E. Shotts, Jr.](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) I always recommend going through the first and second section. It's been a while since I last read through it but I remember some parts of third section being pretty hardware/os specific so it was hard to do all the examples.


## Math Resources
[College Level Mathematics](http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/): A series of college level math textbooks that are freely licensed and good for referencing. Collected and supported by the American Institute of Mathematics and the National Science Foundation.
